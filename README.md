# FreeGrest

FreeGrest is an application used to manage media content (videos, music, text, images...) on an extended screen in a semplified way, through a Control Panel interface.

The advantage of this application is the ease of communication between two screen without direct interaction of user in the extended screen (which is usually difficult and disturbing for the specators.

This app is really a personal project, so you might find some unuseful functionalities - which are however useful for me ;) - the project is licensed under GNU GPL v3 so feel free to improve it or adapt it to your needs.

## Functionalities

The app si substantialy composed of two windows: the control panel and the main panel.

The main panel must be placed on the extended monitor (it's recommended to maximise it), while the control panel can remain on the main screen, unseen from the public, but easily accessible by the user.

The main control panel lets you:

 - edit or hide the title and subtitle of the main panel;

 - edit or hide the countdown to a precise date at the bottom of the main panel;

 - add formatted text to the main panel (COMING SOON);

 - add an image slideshow on the main panel (COMING SOON);

 - add a media file (video or audio) on the main panel (COMING SOON);
